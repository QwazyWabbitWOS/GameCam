Quake2 expects the game file to be in this directory.

The BWAdmin file is named:
gamei386.so

BWAdmin expects the .so file to be named:
gamei386.so.real

Therefore we name the GameCam proxy so BWAdmin can find it.

GameCam expects the game file to be named:
gamei386.real.so


So here's the order:

  BWAdmin    ->       GameCam      ->       LOX Mod
gamei386.so  ->  gamei386.so.real  ->   gamei386.real.so



The GameCam and BWAdmin console variables are documented
in the server.cfg file.

All users have to do to is type "spectator 1" into their console
to use the GameCam. Once in camera mode, they can control it from
the menu.

P.S. Depending on how this works, I may either add the camera code
to the LOX mod or leave it external and make a special binary that
will link to something like: gamei386.lox.so instead of the above.
